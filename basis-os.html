<h1>POSIX faculty</h1>

<p>The <code>os</code> faculty contains various reflexes for interacting with the POSIX
environment within which an Escher program executes. It contains a few simple reflexes
for accessing things like command-line arguments, environment variables, standard file
descriptors, process execution and the like. 

<p>Most reflexes in <code>os</code> are implemented in less than 10 lines of code
and in that sense their implementation is their best documentation. Here we detail
only the process execution reflex <code>os.Process</code>.

<h2>Process execution reflex</h2>

<p>The process reflex requires that three valves, named <code>:Command</code>,
<code>:IO</code> and <code>:Exit</code>, be connected. When a command description
is sent to the <code>:Command</code> valve, the reflex spawns an OS process, described
by the command value. Subsequent commands will block until the spawned process exits.
As soon as the process is executed, a circuit value is sent out to the valve <code>:IO</code>,
containing the standard file descriptors of the executing process. When the process exits,
a circuit value, containing the exit code of the process, is sent out to the <code>:Exit</code> valve.

<p>An example of the command circuit value is as follows:

<pre>
{
	Env {
		"PATH=/abc:/bin"
		"LESS=less"
	}
	Dir "/home/petar"
	Path "/bin/ls"
	Args { "-l", "/" }
}
</pre>

<p>The returned IO circuit value is of the following form:

<pre>
{
	Stdin (io.WriteCloser)
	Stdout (io.ReadCloser)
	Stderr (io.ReadCloser)
}
</pre>

<p>Where the gate values' types, in brackets, are the Go types <code>io.WriteCloser</code>,
<code>io.ReadCloser</code> and <code>io.ReadCloser</code>, respectively.

<p>The exit circuit is of the form

<pre>
{
	Exit (int)
}
</pre>

<p>The following example demonstrates invoking the <code>/bin/ls</code> command
and forwarding its standard output and error to those of the Escher program itself.

<pre>
{
	proc *os.Process
	proc:Command = {
		Path "/bin/ls"
		Args { "/" }
	}

	yio *e.Fork
	proc:IO = yio:

	yio:Stdin = *Ignore
	yio:Stdout = *os.Stdout
	yio:Stderr = *os.Stderr

	yexit *e.Fork
	proc:Exit = yexit:
	
	exit *os.Exit
	yexit:Exit = exit:
}
</pre>

<p>The standard file descriptors of the child process must always be handled.
In this example, standard output and error are forwarded while standard input is
“ignored”. The reflex <code>*Ignore</code> is a “smart” reflex which
ignores primitive values (integers, floats, etc.), whereas it closes <code>io.Closer</code>
objects and it drains <code>io.Reader</code> objects.
