<h1>Reflex basis and faculties</h1>

<p>A faculty is a set of reflexes, similar to a package in Java, or a namespace in C++.

<p>There are two kinds of reflexes in Escher:
<ul>
<li><em>Basis reflexes</em>
	are implemented in the underlying technology —
	the Go language — and linked into the runtime
<li><em>Derivative reflexes</em>
	are compositions of other reflexes,
	described by program circuits
</ul>

<p>We will now have a look at the equivalent of <code>std</code> in C++,
the Escher basis faculty.

<p>Basis reflexes determine the basic arithmetic and data manipulation
operations that Escher programs can ultimately perform, as well as
external technologies that Escher programs might have access to.

<h3>Arithmetic</h3>

<p>There are various ways to design and implement small sets of
arithmetic basis reflexes that would render circuit programs Turing-complete.
We leave the design of such bases to the users of Escher, whose imagination
and use cases might inform choices that we cannot predict from scratch.

<h3>Information flow</h3>

<p>We find that most Escher programs benefit from
a few basic reflexes that control information flow.
We have included a few in the default runtime,
and they are described in <a href="basis-flow.html">a separate page</a>.
These gates can be viewed as Escher's “synchronization” facilities.

<h3>External technologies</h3>

<p>Basis reflexes are also Escher's way of interacting with external technologies
such as input/output devices. The POSIX systems is a canonical example of an
external technology, and Escher has a dedicated
<a href="https://github.com/gocircuit/escher/tree/master/faculty/os"><code>os</code></a>
faculty for it.

<h3>Escher within Escher</h3>

<p>The most powerful feature of Escher is its recursive nature:
Circuit programs can create program circuits and materialize them into other circuit programs.
This programming pattern is enabled by the
<a href="https://github.com/gocircuit/escher/tree/master/faculty/escher"><code>escher</code></a>
faculty, which among other things offers reflexes that materialize program circuits.
