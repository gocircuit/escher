* Connect compiler, programmer and software in a feedback loop, whereby
the compiler infers: Which circuit/valve pairs are historically (over the
dev/use lifecycle of the software library) joined together and how long these
circuit designs stick around over cycles of usage and revisions of development.
Use these insights to inver “types” of data flowing on the wires and provide
code suggestions (as opposed to warning or errors).  I.e. pre-empt the
programmer in making a mistake.
