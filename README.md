# Escher

Escher is a progrmaming language for everything. It can naturally represent both process and data,
while being simpler than a calculator. The remainder of this page constitutes a complete documentation.

Some of the application domains of Escher are:

* Definition and generation of synthetic worlds governed by Physical laws, as in Augmented Reality and the Gaming Industry,
* General purpose concurrent and distributed programming, such as Internet services and cloud applications,
* Relational data representation, as in databases and CAD file formats,
* Real-time control loops, as in Robotics,
* Numerical and scientific computation pipelines,
* And so on.

An early “proposal” for the design of Escher, 
[Escher: A black-and-white language for data and process representation](http://www.maymounkov.org/memex/abstract),
might be an informative (but not necessary) read for the theoretically inclined.

## Meaning

An Escher program is a collection of interconnected _reflexes_. A reflex, the only
abstraction in Escher,
