# TODO - Escher language

* tool to discover blockages
* rename verb to directive
* escher.Replace gate to substitute the residual of containing circuit withâ€¦
* addresses are sugar for a two-sided reflex:
  syntactic address and index on one side, and ...
	* generalize
* download wikipedia data-set
* file reader materializer
* convert non-escher files in source directory in materializers of respective file readers
* We need something like JavaDoc (both the standard for doc comments, and the tool)
* We need documentation in the code, and an API doc (see point above)

## THINK

* remove name/value distinction (delayed because go map keys cannot be circuit or other non-primitives at the moment)
	* possible resolution: make all Go circuit manipulations functional
* (maybe) convert all these TODOs in here to issues (on github)
* device some standard for storing a set of attributes with each gate,
  which can be used for graphical representation:
```escher
myCircuit {
	gateA 123            `// @visual{ colorFg { 255; 0; 0; }; colorBg { 0; 0; 0; }; position2d { 1.0; 1.0; }; position3d { 1.0; 1.0; 1.0; }; }`
	gateB `some value`   `// Some textual comment here @visual{ colorFg { 255; 255; 255; 255; }; colorBg { 0; 0; 0; 255; }; position2d { 1.0; 2.0; }; position3d { 1.0; 2.0; 3.0; }; }`
}
```
* device and formulate a standard naming convention,
  to be used at least in the Escher repo
  (think Java: `ClassName`, `getSomething()`, `CONSTANT_VALUE`, ...)
* device a standard Index (== name-space) scheme
  (think Java: `<reverse-url>.<class-name>.<method-name>`,
  for example: `com.apache.commons.math.Rand.nextInt`)  
  maybe adhere to the go standard (which is also similar to the Java one)
* as file-names do not (currently) appear in the Index (== name-space),
  we might want to enforce (or at least encourage) a similar standard like in Java,
  where the file-name (without the .java extension)
  is supposed to be equal to the class name within.
  In Escher, this would be the contained circuits name.
